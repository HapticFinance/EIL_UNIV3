# EIL research

This is an implementation of the whitepaper "Concentrated Liquidity Analysis in Uniswap V3" from DeFi'22: Proceedings of the 2022 ACM CCS Workshop on Decentralized Finance and Security November 2022, pages 63â€“70, available at https://doi.org/10.1145/3560832.3563438 (paywalled). The code implements the analytical computation of expected impermanent loss for Uniswap V3 and other ideas presented in the paper. It will produce a pdf with the results of the simulation.
