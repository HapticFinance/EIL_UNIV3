# IL research

This code implements concepts introduced in recent research papers on Uniswap V3 such as : 

  - Analytical computation of expected impermanent loss (EIL) [1]
  - Analytical computation of unit impermanent loss per liquidity (UIL) and static replication with options [2]

This work is part of the research conducted while designing the Haptic protocol and is made available for educational purposes.

## Requirements

- R

## Installation

- Install R from [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/) (Ubuntu)
- Clone this repository

## Usage

- Open a terminal and navigate to the repository
- Check that gen_pdf has executable permissions and grant them with `chmod +x gen_report.r`
- Run `./gen_report.r`

The necessary dependencies will be installed and a pdf file will be generated in the `pdf/` folder. The simulation parameters can be found in the `config.r` file.
